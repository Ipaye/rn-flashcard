# FlashCard

A react native application to help quiz you on different topics by displaying flashcard.

# How to run

run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get all the project dependencies, then run `yarn android` to start the dev server. <br>
I developed the app testing with expo client so, to use expo client, use `yarn web` to start the web server and scan the bar code.

> For this you would need to download expo on your device

# Platform Test

The application was tested on an android device using expo client
